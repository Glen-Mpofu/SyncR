<h3>Why SyncR?</h3>

Managing files across multiple devices or drives can be messy. Manual copy-paste is error-prone, and robocopy (while powerful) can be intimidating for non-technical users.

<h3>SyncR bridges that gap by providing:</h3>

✅ An easy-to-use interface for creating and managing sync jobs

✅ One-way and two-way synchronization options

✅ Real-time logs and progress tracking

✅ Start/Stop controls for better user control

✅ Configurable sync parameters (fine-tune your backups)

Whether you’re a student, a professional, or an IT admin, SyncR makes keeping your files in sync simple and reliable.
